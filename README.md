Pocket Webapp for Chrome
=======================

This is basically just a nice adaptation of the Pocket icon and a Chrome manifest. This lets you use Pocket like a nice shortcut, and open it pinned by default.

To install:

1. Go To: _Chrome Preferences_ > _Extensions_.
2. If not already enabled, select _Developer mode_ checkbox.
3. Click on _Load unpacked extensionâ€¦_ and find the `pocket_app` folder.

Please suggest changes, fixes, or improvements.
